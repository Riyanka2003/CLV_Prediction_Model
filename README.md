# CLV_Prediction_Model
Aim :- To predict the lifetime value of customers based on their historical interactions using regression techniques.  

Description :- This project applies regression modeling to estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) — the projected revenue a customer will generate over their relationship with a business. By leveraging historical transaction and behavioral data, we identify key patterns and build predictive models to support marketing, retention, and business growth strategies.

Technologies:-
- Python – programming and data analysis
- Pandas – data manipulation
- NumPy – numerical operations
- Scikit-learn – regression models and evaluation
- Matplotlib – data visualization
- JupyterLab Notebook - to see the complete functioning at one place.
